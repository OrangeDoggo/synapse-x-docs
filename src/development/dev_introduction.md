# Developing for Synapse X

We will now be showing how you can make your own scripts for Synapse X. Please note the following things though before we begin:

* This development guide assumes you already have knowledge of the Lua programming language. If this is your first time scripting in Lua, we suggest reading the [Lua 5.1 manual](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/) before this.
* We will be covering some very advanced topics here in this guide. We will try to explain these in the simplest terms possible, but some cannot be explained without full detail.

Lets now start off with the [script environment](./script_env.md).
