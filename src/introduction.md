# Introduction
Synapse X is a powerful, easy to use scripting engine. Synapse X allows for unparalleled speed, stability, and compatibility with all scripts made for it due to our state of the art slua ('Synapse Lua') engine. We will be showing specific features of slua later on in this guide.

This guide will show you how to make your own scripts for Synapse X, then provide documentation for any future projects you make.

Before any of that though, lets first [install Synapse X](./install/installation.md).
